IRON - GHOSTBUSTERS

This is my videogame's project for the third Ironhack's week. The structure of the code consists on two HTML documents. The main one is called "index2.html", and it's the presentation one. There's a link to start the game, that drives us to "index.html". That's where the game can be played.

I've divided my code into some diferent files. First of all, the "main.js" file will allow the game to run, and set the key codes. Then, a first main constructor function is built, called "Game.js", and that's where the instances of the proper game and the other constructor functions are created. 

In addition to those two files, every different object has been created on a separate js file: the chrono, the pointer, the ghost... every element has it's own sheet, with their structure (properties, methods, callbacks...). 

You can find the project by accesing to my GitHub remote repo:

Have fun!
